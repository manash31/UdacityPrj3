# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
1) Run through each point from OWASP Top 10 and check if there is any loop holes.
2) Apply AWS WAF

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
1) Yes this would definitely a very good point in order to prevent access from external world.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
1) No all the encryption happen post you enable encryption. All those data that present before encryption enablement will not encrypt.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
1) I believe Original cloudformation template mean the one provided in Starter project. In that case there will be many open vulnerable and unsecure ends will be there.
