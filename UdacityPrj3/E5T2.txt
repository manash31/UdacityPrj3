# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates :- AWS CloudFormation security tests

### Example vulnerability 
* Ensure MFA is enabled in root user
* W36 - Security group rules without a description obsucre there purpose and may lead to bad practice 
in ensuring that they only allow traffic from ports and sources/destinations requied.


##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities :- AWS Inspector

### Example vulnerability

1) This rule helps determine whether minimum length for passwords is configured on your EC2 instances.

2) Description This directory contains system cron jobs that need to run on an hourly basis. The files in this directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are instead edited by system administrators using a text editor. The commands below restrict read/write and search access to user and group root, preventing regular users from accessing this directory. Rationale Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged users could provide them the means for gaining unauthorized elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain elevated privileges or circumvent auditing controls.



##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities :- AWS Guardduty

### Example vulnerability
10.192.11.220 is performing SSH brute force attacks against i-06ec9b96297cc891f. Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password
