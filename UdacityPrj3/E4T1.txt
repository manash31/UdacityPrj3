# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

Ans:-
a) Enable encryption in S3 bucket.
	* This is one of the very important feature give by S3 service where user can encrypt all the files inside the bucket.
b) Enable IAM policy to access S3 bucket
	* This is another important feature where one can give access to role based access. One of the major benifit of role based access is that you can restrict access to S3 bucket via applciation deployed in EC2 or it can be given to other lambda services. Another benifit of role based access is that you don't need to store or preserve any credentials.
